# Word Roots
A project that incorporates angular and $http to fetch data in a JSON file and display it in a nice format. Also, will eventually display words with more than one root and provide a better interface to add/ look up new words and or definitions for words..

# TODO
[] Move scrollbar to be below navbar
[] Rename `_wr.root` (ng-model for search bar) to be search
[] Add toggle to toggle search bar, or transform into a directive
[] Make the tiles directives
